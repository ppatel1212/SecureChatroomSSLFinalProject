# SecureChatroomSSLFinalProject
This project was designed for my Network Security and Principles class. The objective was to create a secure chatroom program that uses SSL encryption to encrypt messages.
There is a detailed description in the "Paper" folder that contains information and issues that I encountered while working on this project.
